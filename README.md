Open-source domain registry platform. Revolutionizing ccTLD and gTLD management with Namingo.

## Introduction

Namingo is a state-of-the-art open-source domain registry platform, diligently crafted to serve ccTLD, gTLD, brand and private domain registries. Written from scratch in 2023/2024, it adheres to the latest standards, ensuring a cutting-edge experience. 

Namingo is optimally designed for the upcoming ICANN application round, providing a straightforward and easily updatable platform. Its contemporary architecture and intuitive interface make it an ideal choice for efficient and modern domain registry management.

## Get Involved

**Namingo** is now complete, thanks to our dedicated community. The journey doesn't end here, and we invite volunteers to help us continue testing and improving Namingo.

Namingo is compatible with Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 LTS and Debian 12, supporting MariaDB/MySQL databases. We are also seeking testers for new operating systems and database setups, including AlmaLinux, Alpine Linux, FreeBSD 14, and Windows, with both MariaDB/MySQL and PostgreSQL options.

Namingo efficiently manages up to 150,000 domains on a VPS setup with 2 cores, 4GB RAM, and an 11GB SSD. It can handle up to 1,000,000 domains on a more robust VPS configuration with 8 cores, 32GB RAM, and a 125GB NVMe SSD, though a few minor issues are noted in the [issues tab](https://github.com/getnamingo/registry/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%221+000+000+domains+issue%22). Zone generation for 1 million domains takes approximately 6 minutes.

Additionally, we are looking for assistance from gTLD operators to test Namingo by providing access to ICANN and other relevant systems. Your contributions are invaluable in refining and expanding Namingo's capabilities. Join us in ensuring Namingo remains the best in its class.

## Documentation

Our documentation provides comprehensive guidance on installation, configuration, and initial operation, ensuring you have all the information you need to successfully manage your domain registry.

### Installation and Update Instructions

#### Installer

To begin, simply copy the command below and paste it into your server terminal. This installation process is optimized for a fresh VPS running Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 or Debian 12.

**Minimum requirement:** a VPS with at least 1 CPU core, 2 GB RAM, and 10 GB hard drive space. Please use MySQL or MariaDB.

```bash
wget https://namingo.org/install.sh -O install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

This command will download and execute the `install.sh` script from Namingo's website, which automates the installation process.

*IPv6 Requirement:* If your system lacks IPv6 support, test with `ping -6 ipv6.google.com`. To prevent installer issues, edit `/etc/gai.conf` and uncomment or add the following line

```bash
precedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100
```

In the `config.php` files of WHOIS/DAS components make sure you replace `::` with `false` or for EPP - with `0.0.0.0`

#### Legacy Installation Guide

For those who prefer a more hands-on approach or need detailed installation instructions, refer to the [Legacy Installation Guide](docs/install.md). However, we recommend using the installer for a more streamlined experience.

#### Update Steps

- v1.0.3 to v1.0.4 - backup registry, download and run the [update104.sh](docs/update104.sh) script.

- v1.0.2 to v1.0.3 - backup registry, download and run the [update103.sh](docs/update103.sh) script.

- v1.0.1 to v1.0.2 - backup registry, download and run the [update102.sh](docs/update102.sh) script.
