```

Activate and reload Apache2:

```bash
systemctl enable apache2
systemctl restart apache2
```

_________________

**And now is the right time to import the provided database file(s) for your database type using Adminer.**

## 7. Control Panel Setup:

Use a file management tool or command line to copy the entire ```registry/cp/``` directory and place it into the web server's root directory, typically ```/var/www/```. The target path should be ```/var/www/cp/```.

```bash
cp -r /opt/registry/cp /var/www
```

### Configure Environment File:

Open your command line interface and navigate to the ```cp``` (control panel) directory.

Locate the file named ```env-sample``` (```/var/www/cp/env-sample```) in the control panel (```cp```) directory.

Rename this file to ```.env``` and update the settings within this file to suit your specific environment and application needs.

### Install Dependencies:

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

This command will install the dependencies defined in your ```composer.json``` file, ensuring that your control panel has all the necessary components to operate effectively.

### Install Optional Dependencies:

Execute the following command to install the optional dependencies:

```bash
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

### Creating an Admin User:

1. Navigate to the 'bin' Directory: Change to the 'bin' subdirectory where the admin user creation script is located. (```create_admin_user.php```)

2. Update Admin User Details: Open the script and enter the desired details for the admin user, such as email, username, and password.

3. Execute the Script: Run the script to create the admin user in your system.

4. Verify Admin Access: Attempt to log in with the new admin credentials to ensure they are functioning correctly.

5. Remove the Script: Once verified, delete the script to maintain system security.

### Download TLD List:

To get the starting list of TLDs (Top-Level Domains) from ICANN and cache it for quick access later, please run the following command:

```bash
php /var/www/cp/bin/file_cache.php
```

### Setup Cache Directory:

To setup the correct owner of the panel cache directory, please run the following command:

```bash
chown www-data:www-data /var/www/cp/cache
```

### Setting Up Redis Session Storage:

To utilize Redis for session storage, you need to install the necessary packages and configure your environment accordingly. Follow these steps to set up Redis session storage:

```bash
cd /var/www/cp
composer require predis/predis pinga/session-redis
```

After installation, log out of your application if you are currently logged in. This ensures that the session starts afresh with the new configuration.

Clear your browser cookies related to the application. This step is crucial as it removes any existing session cookies that were set using the previous session storage mechanism.

Upon your next login, Redis will be used for storing session data. The new sessions will be created and managed through Redis, providing a more scalable and efficient session management system.

**Note**: Ensure that your Redis server is properly configured and running before proceeding with these steps. If in doubt, check with:

```bash
systemctl status redis-server
```

## 8. Setup Web Lookup:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/whois
cd /opt/registry/whois/web
cp -r * /var/www/whois
cd /var/www/whois/
composer require gregwar/captcha
mv config.php.dist config.php
```

- Configure all options in ```config.php```.

## 9. Setup WHOIS:

```bash
cd /opt/registry/whois/port43
composer install
mv config.php.dist config.php
```

- Configure all options in ```config.php```.

- Copy ```docs/whois.service``` to ```/etc/systemd/system/```. Change only User and Group lines to your user and group.

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start whois.service
systemctl enable whois.service
```

After that you can manage WHOIS via systemctl as any other service.

## 10. Setup RDAP:

```bash
cd /opt/registry/rdap
composer install
mv config.php.dist config.php
```

- Configure all options in ```config.php```.

- Copy ```docs/rdap.service``` to ```/etc/systemd/system/```. Change only User and Group lines to your user and group.

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start rdap.service
systemctl enable rdap.service
```

After that you can manage RDAP via systemctl as any other service.

## 11. Setup EPP:

```bash
cd /opt/registry/epp
composer install
mv config.php.dist config.php
```

Configure all options in ```config.php```.

To create test certificates (cert.pem and key.pem):

```bash
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```

- Copy ```docs/epp.service``` to ```/etc/systemd/system/```. Change only User and Group lines to your user and group.

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start epp.service
systemctl enable epp.service
```

After that you can manage EPP via systemctl as any other service.

## 12. Setup Automation Scripts:

```bash
cd /opt/registry/automation
composer install
mv config.php.dist config.php
```

Configure all options in ```config.php```.

### Install Optional Dependencies:

Execute one of the following commands to install the optional dependencies:

```bash
composer require utopia-php/messaging
```

or

```bash
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

This command will install one of the packages which are essential for the message broker script to function correctly.

### Configuring the Message Broker

You can easily configure the message broker for email delivery in ```config.php```. It is compatible with SendGrid, Mailgun API, and PHPMailer for those opting to use their own SMTP server. All necessary settings are conveniently located under the mailer_ lines within the file.

For establishing your own mail server, Mox, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/mjl-/mox), provides a comprehensive solution. Install Mox following its GitHub instructions, then enter the required details in the ```config.php``` file.

To run the Message Broker, execute the following commands:

```bash
/usr/bin/php /opt/registry/automation/msg_producer.php &
/usr/bin/php /opt/registry/automation/msg_worker.php &
```

This will start the system and place it in the background, allowing it to run independently of your current terminal session.

### Setting Up an Audit Trail Database for Namingo

To create an audit trail database for Namingo, start by editing the configuration file located at `/opt/registry/automation/audit.json` with the correct database details. This includes specifying the database connection parameters such as host, username, and password. Once your configuration is set up, run the command:

```bash
/opt/registry/automation/vendor/bin/audit -v audit /opt/registry/automation/audit.json
```

This will initialize and configure the audit trail functionality. This process ensures that all necessary tables and structures are set up in the registryAudit database, enabling comprehensive auditing of Namingo's operations.

**Currently, the audit trail setup for Namingo is supported only with MySQL or MariaDB databases. If you're using PostgreSQL, you'll need to utilize an external tool for audit logging, such as [pgAudit](https://minervadb.com/index.php/pgaudit-open-source-postgresql-audit-logging/), which provides detailed audit logging capabilities tailored for PostgreSQL environments.**

### Setup Backup

To ensure the safety and availability of your data in Namingo, it's crucial to set up and verify automated backups. Begin by editing the ```backup.json``` file in the automation directory, where you'll input your database details. Ensure that the details for the database are accurately entered in two specified locations within the ```backup.json``` file.

Additionally, check that the cronjob for PHPBU is correctly scheduled on your server, as this automates the backup process. You can verify this by reviewing your server's cronjob list. These steps are vital to maintain regular, secure backups of your system, safeguarding against data loss and ensuring business continuity. 

### RDE (Registry data escrow) configuration:

#### Generate the Key Pair:

Create a configuration file, say key-config, with the following content:

```yaml
%echo Generating a default key
Key-Type: RSA
Key-Length: 2048
Subkey-Type: RSA
Subkey-Length: 2048
Name-Real: Your Name
Name-Comment: Your Comment
Name-Email: your.email@example.com
Expire-Date: 0
%no-protection
%commit
%echo done
```

Replace "Your Name", "Your Comment", and "your.email@example.com" with your details.

Use the following command to generate the key:

```bash
gpg2 --batch --generate-key key-config
```

Your GPG key pair will now be generated.

#### Exporting Your Keys:

Public key:

```bash
gpg2 --armor --export your.email@example.com > publickey.asc
```

Replace `your-email@example.com` with the email address you used when generating the key.

Private key:

```bash
gpg2 --armor --export-secret-keys your.email@example.com > privatekey.asc
```

#### Secure Your Private Key:

Always keep your private key secure. Do not share it. If someone gains access to your private key, they can impersonate you in cryptographic operations.

#### Use in RDE deposit generation:

Please send the exported `publickey.asc` to your RDE provider, and also place the path to `privatekey.asc` in the escrow.php system as required.

### Running the Automation System

Once you have successfully configured all automation scripts, you are ready to initiate the automation system. Please review ```/opt/registry/automation/cron.php``` and enable all services if you are running a gTLD. Then proceed by adding the following cron job to the system crontab using ```crontab -e```:

```bash
* * * * * /usr/bin/php /opt/registry/automation/cron.php 1>> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## 13. Setup DAS:

```bash
cd /opt/registry/das
composer install
mv config.php.dist config.php
```

Configure all options in ```config.php```.

- Copy ```docs/das.service``` to ```/etc/systemd/system/```. Change only User and Group lines to your user and group.

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start das.service
systemctl enable das.service
```

After that you can manage DAS via systemctl as any other service.

## 14. Setup Hidden Master DNS with BIND:

Although Namingo is equipped with BIND by default for this purpose, you can opt for NSD, or Knot DNS if you are more comfortable with those systems.

### Install BIND9 and its utilities with:

```bash
apt install bind9 bind9-utils bind9-doc
```

### Generate a TSIG key:

Generate a TSIG key which will be used to authenticate DNS updates between the master and slave servers. **Note: replace ```test``` with your TLD.**

```bash
cd /etc/bind
tsig-keygen -a HMAC-SHA256 test.key
```

The output will be in the format that can be directly included in your BIND configuration files. It looks something like this:

```bash
key "test.key" {
    algorithm hmac-sha256;
    secret "base64-encoded-secret==";
};
```

Copy this output for use in the configuration files of both the master and slave DNS servers. (```/etc/bind/named.conf.local```)

### Configure the Named Configuration File (Please Choose One):

1. Without DNSSEC:

Edit the named.conf.local file:

```bash
nano /etc/bind/named.conf.local
```

Add the following zone definition:

```bash
zone "test." {
    type master;
    file "/var/lib/bind/test.zone";
    allow-transfer { key "test.key"; };
    also-notify { <slave-server-IP>; };
};
```

Replace ```<slave-server-IP>``` with the actual IP address of your slave server. Replace ```test``` with your TLD.

Use rndc to reload BIND:

```bash
systemctl restart bind9
```

Configure the `Zone Writer` in Registry Automation and run it manually the first time.

```bash
php /opt/registry/automation/write-zone.php
```

2. Using DNSSEC with BIND9:

Edit the named.conf.local file:

```bash
nano /etc/bind/named.conf.local
```

Add the following DNSSEC policy:

```bash
dnssec-policy "namingo-policy" {
    keys {
        ksk lifetime P3M algorithm ed25519;
        zsk lifetime P1M algorithm ed25519;
    };
    max-zone-ttl 86400;
    dnskey-ttl 3600;
    zone-propagation-delay 3600;
    parent-propagation-delay 7200;
    parent-ds-ttl 86400;
};
```

Add the following zone definition:

```bash
zone "test." {
    type master;
    file "/var/lib/bind/test.zone";
    dnssec-policy "namingo-policy";
    key-directory "/var/lib/bind";
    inline-signing yes;
    allow-transfer { key "test.key"; };
    also-notify { <slave-server-IP>; };
};
```

Replace ```<slave-server-IP>``` with the actual IP address of your slave server. Replace ```test``` with your TLD.

Initially, you will need to generate the DNSSEC ZSK and KSK manually:

```bash
dnssec-keygen -a Ed25519 -n ZONE test.
dnssec-keygen -a Ed25519 -n ZONE -f KSK test.
```

After generating the keys, place them in ```/var/lib/bind```. Run ```dnssec-dsfromkey Ktest.EXAMPLE.key``` on the KSK key you just generated, and the DS record must be submitted to IANA once setup is complete.

Use rndc to tell BIND to load and use the new keys:

```bash
systemctl restart bind9
rndc loadkeys test.
```

Configure the `Zone Writer` in Registry Automation and run it manually the first time.

```bash
php /opt/registry/automation/write-zone.php
```

3. Using DNSSEC with OpenDNSSEC:

Edit the named.conf.local file:

```bash
nano /etc/bind/named.conf.local
```

Add the following zone definition:

```bash
zone "test." {
    type master;
    file "/var/lib/bind/test.zone.signed";
    allow-transfer { key "test.key"; };
    also-notify { <slave-server-IP>; };
};
```

Replace ```<slave-server-IP>``` with the actual IP address of your slave server. Replace ```test``` with your TLD.

Install OpenDNSSEC:

```bash
apt install opendnssec opendnssec-enforcer-sqlite3 opendnssec-signer softhsm2
```

Update files in `/etc/opendnssec` to match your registry policy. As minimum, please enable at least Signer Threads in `/etc/opendnssec/conf.xml`, but we recommend to fully review [all the files](https://wiki.opendnssec.org/configuration/confxml/). Then run the following commands:

```bash
softhsm2-util --init-token --slot 0 --label OpenDNSSEC --pin 1234 --so-pin 1234
ods-enforcer-db-setup
rm /etc/opendnssec/prevent-startup
ods-control start
ods-enforcer policy import
ods-enforcer zone add -z test -p default -i /var/lib/bind/test.zone
```

Use rndc to reload BIND:

```bash
systemctl restart bind9
```

Configure the `Zone Writer` in Registry Automation and run it manually the first time.

```bash
php /opt/registry/automation/write-zone.php
```

### Check BIND9 Configuration:

```bash
named-checkconf
named-checkzone test /var/lib/bind/test.zone
```

### Restart BIND9 Service:

```bash
systemctl restart bind9
```

### Verify Zone Loading:

Check the BIND9 logs to ensure that the .test zone is loaded without errors:

```bash
grep named /var/log/syslog
```

### 14.1 Regular DNS Server Setup:

Before editing the configuration files, you need to copy the TSIG key from your hidden master server. The TSIG key configuration should look like this:

```bash
key "test.key" {
    algorithm hmac-sha256;
    secret "base64-encoded-secret==";
};
```

#### Installation of BIND9:

```bash
apt update
apt install bind9 bind9-utils bind9-doc
```

#### Add the TSIG key to the BIND Configuration:

Create a directory to store zone files:

```bash
mkdir /var/cache/bind/zones
```

Edit the `named.conf.local` file:

```bash
nano /etc/bind/named.conf.local
```

First, define the TSIG key at the top of the file:

```bash
key "test.key" {
    algorithm hmac-sha256;
    secret "base64-encoded-secret=="; // Replace with your actual base64-encoded key
};
```

Then, add the slave zone configuration:

```bash
zone "test." {
    type slave;
    file "/var/cache/bind/zones/test.zone";
    masters { 192.0.2.1 key "test.key"; }; // IP of the hidden master and TSIG key reference
    allow-query { any; }; // Allow queries from all IPs
    allow-transfer { none; }; // Disable zone transfers (AXFR) to others
};
```

Make sure to replace `192.0.2.1` with the IP address of your hidden master server and `base64-encoded-secret==` with the actual secret from your TSIG key.

#### Adjusting Permissions and Ownership:

Ensure BIND has permission to write to the zone file and that the files are owned by the BIND user:

```bash
chown bind:bind /var/cache/bind/zones
chmod 755 /var/cache/bind/zones
```

#### Restart BIND9 Service:

After making these changes, restart the BIND9 service to apply them:

```bash
systemctl restart bind9
```

#### Verify Configuration and Zone Transfer:

```bash
named-checkconf
grep 'transfer of "test."' /var/log/syslog
```

## 15. Setup Monitoring:

For effective monitoring of your registry system, we highly recommend utilizing Prometheus.

```bash
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.48.1/prometheus-2.48.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvfz prometheus-2.48.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cp prometheus-2.48.1.linux-amd64/prometheus /usr/local/bin/
cp prometheus-2.48.1.linux-amd64/promtool /usr/local/bin/
useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false prometheus
mkdir /etc/prometheus
mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
cp -r prometheus-2.48.1.linux-amd64/consoles /etc/prometheus
cp -r prometheus-2.48.1.linux-amd64/console_libraries /etc/prometheus
chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
chown -R prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
```

Place the following in the ```/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml``` and customize as needed:

```
# Global settings and defaults.
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s  # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.
  evaluation_interval: 15s  # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds.

# Alertmanager configuration (commented out by default).
# alerting:
#   alertmanagers:
#   - static_configs:
#     - targets:
#       - localhost:9093

# Load and evaluate rules in this file.
# rule_files:
#   - "first_rules.yml"
#   - "second_rules.yml"

# Scrape configuration for running Prometheus on the same machine.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']

  # Example job for scraping an HTTP service.
  - job_name: 'http_service'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['<your_http_service>:80']

  # Example job for scraping an HTTPS service.
  - job_name: 'https_service'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['<your_https_service>:443']

  # Example job for scraping a DNS server.
  - job_name: 'dns_monitoring'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['<your_dns_server>:53']

# Add additional jobs as needed for your services.
```

Run the monitoring tool using:

```bash
prometheus --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

The tool will be available at ```http://<your_server_ip>:9090```
